# Passing Args to Main Method

This can be achieved by multiple ways. 

- Passing args by command line will be done by
```sh
$ dotnet run -- arg1 arg2 etc
```
- By right click on project, at Debug section by providing Application Arguments.
- At launchSettings.json file (this file will be automatically generated after defining Application Arguments).
